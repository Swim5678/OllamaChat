## Key Guidelines

1. Strictly maintain the designated Java and Paper API versions; do not attempt to modify or upgrade them.
2. Ensure successful compilation not only before finalizing but also strictly after work completion to guarantee the codebase is error-free.
3. Prioritize asynchronous operations to the fullest extent to strictly prevent blocking the main thread.
4. Maintain a professional tone and strictly avoid the use of emojis.
5. Adhere to Clean Code principles; strictly avoid spaghetti code and ensure logic is readable.
6. Use Traditional Chinese (繁體中文) exclusively when drafting plans, reasoning, and reports.
7. Maximize modular design to ensure clear separation of concerns and scalability.
8. Implement robust resource management by ensuring all event listeners, scheduled tasks, and database connections are properly registered and unregistered/closed.
9. Enforce comprehensive error handling and logging for all external operations (e.g., file I/O, database) to aid in post-production debugging and stability.
10. Prioritize Dependency Injection; strictly minimize the use of global state, static fields, and Singleton patterns. Instead, prefer constructor injection to manage dependencies, ensuring classes remain decoupled, testable, and architecturally pure.
11. Using ConcurrentHashMap instead of HashMap
